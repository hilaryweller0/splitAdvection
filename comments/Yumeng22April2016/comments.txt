Sorry for my late response, I have put the data into the data directory
and write the mesh based on x_m and y_m in lyx. I should note that I
made a bit change in the quadratic function and it looks more consistent
with the piecewise linear function. f=(x-x_m)^2/sqrt(3)/x_m +
y_m-x_m/4*np.sqrt(3), such that we get mesh like the PDF file in the
attachments.

This mesh leads to a denser grids at the upper right and upper left
boundaries.

For large Courant number, the scheme is stable for dt = 20 and dt = 10,
but unstable for dt = 5, dx = 50. I suspect the instability arise from
the denser mesh at the boundaries with high resolution (see the high
error region near the boundaries) as I observe similar behavior at high
resolution of dx = 25 in small Courant number.
