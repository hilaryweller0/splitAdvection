From Ram:

(1) The reference "Kattal" should be  corrected to "Katta" 
(2) On page 29, the reference "Lin and Rood, 1996"  is incorrect. The cubed-sphere geometry 
   did not "exist"   those days!   
You might want to refer "Putman & Lin (JCP, 2007)," their more recent work instead. 

(3) One major focus  of your study is dimensional splitting. However, the cascade-interpolation based SL
      advection comes in this class, where the splitting is done along a sequence of
  1D hybrid (Lag/Eulerian) coordinates  for a multi-dimensional problem.  This reduces the complexity of 3D
transport  from  O(N^3) to O(N).    Splitting error for such scheme is negligible even for large Courant numbers, moreover it doesn't depend on grid orthogonality. 
 I think it is worth mentioning  about such schemes in the introduction. 

 See the recent work appeared in JCP 2015 by Russians, their  scheme is pretty impressive.
"3D Conservative Cascade Semi-Lagrangian Transport Scheme Using Reduced Latitude-Longitude Grid"
by Vladimir Shashkin, Rostislav Fadeev &  Mikhail Tolstykh. 

Another Example is  the SLICE scheme by Zerroukat et al.  

Both of these schemes are based on my own old paper: 

    R. Nair, J. Scroggs, F. Semazzi, Efficient conservative global transport schemes for climate and atmospheric chemistry models, Mon. Wea. Rev. 130 (2002) 2059 â€“ 2073.
