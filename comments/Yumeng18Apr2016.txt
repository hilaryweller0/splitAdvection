Thank you for the suggestions. I am sorry for figure 12 in the section
3.3 where I made a mistake when I put the data into the figure. The
sequence of the data is wrong. The instability is not exposed due to
large total time but the large time step and the error norm is
consistent in both figure 11 and figure 12. I have updated the data in
git. And we may need to rewrite some parts of section 3.3.

I think figure 5 for c = 10 could be a good indication for the
instability that could be hidden due to short total time, where we can
get a relatively small error norm with large dt and the error gets
infinity for smaller dt.

I have updated the font size in figure 3 and 4, which should be clearer.

In response to Stephen's comments, I just got the result for mesh of
quadratic function and the convergence rate with respect to dx. The
stability difference is not quite obvious. I am afraid that, in the
advection over orography test case, we already have a much smoother mesh
and the flow is less challenging. In advection over orography test case,
the convergence rate reduce to first order (from 2nd order) when the
resolution increases (steeper representation of orography).

As for the deformational Courant number, do you need me to provide the
numbers in git or do you have it with you? I know deformational Courant
number is a restriction for semi-Lagrangian schemes, but in my opinion,
I think the deformational Courant number <= 1 is not enough to ensure
the stability, which should be more mesh relevant. The stable dt would
be smaller for steeper meshes.
