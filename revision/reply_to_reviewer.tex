Q: quasi-uniform resolution doesn't help better exploit modern architectures; they're largely orthogonal concepts. Quasi-uniform resolution just improves the global time step restriction.

A: Quasi-uniform resolution indeed help better exploit modern architectures. The lat-lon grid leads to convergence of resolution toward poles and restricts the time stepping. These problems are usually solved by semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian schemes. The modern computers use increasing number of cores and the efficiency is limited by the scalability. Implicit solvers and semi-Lagrangian advection result in massive data communications \citep{ST12}, which limits the scalability around poles.
