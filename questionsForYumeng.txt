In Section 2.2, how are u_ij, v_ij, u_w, u_e, v_n and v_s modified for non-orthogonal grids. Presumably you need to use J_e, J_n, J_s and J_w?

Is fig 2b up to date?

Is fig 3a and 3b up to date?

In fig 3a, 3c and 3d the min and max values refer to the min and max errors. However fig 3b says min=-0.995, max-0.963 which is many times larger than all of the other errors. Do you need to put the correct values in?

Same comment for fig 4b
